## Description

Write an end-to-end smoke test that validates the full MVP loop: prompt input, world generation, exploration, dialogue with a character, event processing, and save/load. Uses mocked AI responses to keep the test deterministic and fast. This is the final validation that all systems integrate correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Smoke test covers: prompt -> world generation -> exploration movement
- [ ] Smoke test covers: character interaction -> dialogue flow -> response selection
- [ ] Smoke test covers: event system processing (world tick with mocked AI)
- [ ] Smoke test covers: save to SQLite -> load from SQLite -> verify state preserved
- [ ] All AI calls use mocked responses for determinism
- [ ] Test runs in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Test is runnable via `bun test`

## Implementation Steps

_To be filled in when the task is started._

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-12 12:59:29 EST
Initial creation. Broken out from Polish task (20260212114218). This is the final integration validation — blocked by AI Dialogue, Event System, and both design doc tasks.
