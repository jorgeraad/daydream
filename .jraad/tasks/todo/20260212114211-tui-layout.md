## Description

Build the multi-panel TUI layout: game viewport (main area), side panel (mini-map placeholder + context info), and narrative bar (bottom scrollable text area). Handle responsive terminal resize. The context panel shows location name, time of day, and nearby NPCs. GameShell wires the layout as the top-level orchestrator.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-panel layout: viewport + side panel + narrative bar
- [ ] Layout uses OpenTUI Flexbox and adapts to terminal resize
- [ ] Side panel contains mini-map placeholder (FrameBuffer) and context panel
- [ ] Context panel displays location name, time of day, nearby NPC names
- [ ] Narrative bar is a ScrollBoxRenderable with scrollable text
- [ ] Minimum 80x24 terminal size handled gracefully
- [ ] GameShell orchestrates layout creation and system wiring
- [ ] Player movement still works within the viewport panel
- [ ] Unit tests for GameShell initialization and mode management
- [ ] Visual smoke test: full game chrome renders with panels + walking player

## Implementation Steps
