## Description

Final MVP polish: multi-zone world with lazy generation and preloading, zone transitions with visual effects, mini-map rendering of explored zones, ambient animations (water shimmer, torch flicker), time-of-day color palette shifts, and loading animations. This brings the MVP to feature-complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-zone world: new zones generated lazily as player approaches edges
- [ ] Adjacent zones preloaded 1-2 zones ahead of player movement
- [ ] Zone transition animation (fade/slide via color dimming)
- [ ] Distant zones unloaded from memory (remain in SQLite)
- [ ] Mini-map renders explored zones in the side panel FrameBuffer
- [ ] Water shimmer animation (alternating tile characters on timer)
- [ ] Torch/light flicker animation
- [ ] Time-of-day palette shifts (warm dawn/dusk, cool night, bright noon)
- [ ] Loading animations during world/zone generation
- [ ] AnimationManager with requestLive()/dropLive() lifecycle
- [ ] Unit tests for AnimationManager (add, remove, update lifecycle)
- [ ] Unit tests for zone preloading logic (which zones to generate)
- [ ] Unit tests for time-of-day palette color calculations
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test: full MVP loop (prompt → world → explore → talk → events → save/load)

## Implementation Steps

_To be filled in when the task is started._
